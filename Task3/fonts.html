  <h1 style="text-align: center;">History of advertising</h1>
  <div style="text-indent: 20px; ">
    <p>
      Ad vertere from Latin means <span style="font-style: italic;">&laquo;to turn toward&raquo;</span>, which clearly 
      shows that the purpose of advertising is to catch the client’s attention. Advertising is usually paid by sponsors 
      and transmitted via mass media. While traditional media includes newspapers, TV, outdoor advertising, the new forms 
      of media involve blogs, forums, websites, e-mails, text messages. Advertising can be of two types: 
      <span style="font-style: italic;">commercial</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">non-commercial</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Commercial advertisements</span> usually use branding to produce increased consumption of 
      their product. It helps to associate a product with a certain image of high quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Non-commercial advertisements</span> have nothing to do with consumer products. They are 
      thought to advertise political parties, religious organizations, interest groups etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      To advertise means to make information public. But nowadays advertising doesn’t limit itself by a word
      <span style="font-style: italic;">publicity</span>. Modern advertising has a task to show a product in a positive
      and pleasant way. It has an aim to make us want to buy it. But how and when did advertising appear?
    </p>
    <p>
      The advertisement has existed since antiquity time. At first there were murals that informed about gladiator
      fights. In the middle Ages public heralds stood in the centre of the city and gave last news.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <span style="font-weight: bold;">the 15th century</span> there was a good development of printing. After that
      posters and leaflets appeared. Two centuries later the first newspapers began to publish advertisements. But it is
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">the 20th century</span> when advertising really explodes. It followed the
      invention of radio and TV.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the United States companies have worked with advertisers <span style="font-weight: bold;">since 1930</span>.
      They invented packaging that had to attract customers. They also created an idea of product placement. It means 
      that a product is shown in the movies. After that it gets well-known and well-sold. For example, it was made with 
      the luxury cars which were shown in <span style="font-weight: bold;">James Bondfilms</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nowadays the new territory of commercials is Internet with social networks. Small software called cookies allows
      offering ads according to the tastes of Internet users. Certainly, in the near future the commercial advertising
      will be personalized for each of us.
